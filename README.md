# oddball
MATLAB code for auditory oddball task with eyetracking.
*There might be many bugs!* 
This is just a super simple example for how to play sound and record eyetracking using Psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) in MATLAB.

*SPECIAL NOTE: The sounds in the folder 'SoundFiles' have not been RMS equalised!!!*
